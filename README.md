# game-of-life

took a couple hour to make a game of life implimentation to remind myself how to use jquery and also i've never done a GOL implimentation before so i wanted to try it. i don't think i implemented the rules exactly correctly (this is most likely due to me using a finite playing field and not an infinite one), but it's good enough for an afternoon. maybe i'll come back to it.
